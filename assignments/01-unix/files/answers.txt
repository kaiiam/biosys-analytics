# You might have expected that the total number of lines in the previous question would be
# 45 (15 * 3), but it should not be. Why is it more or less?

Answer: it was more as there were the index files created from the wget commands,
along with ths file answers.txt. I would have expected 6*15 = 90 but I guess some of the
files were less than 15 lines.

# Remove the file called "foo"
rm foo
